# Challenge 1 - feature request challenge

## Description
This is a first assignment in our class. 
On the challenge it helped me remember "What's Semantic Elements for HTML" and when will we need to use or not use <div>.
"What's differents between <section> & <article>. 
This time mainly I changed non-semantic element <div> to semantic elements <figcaption>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, <aside> and without change any original structure.
